## Music Downloader using Spotify Web API

SpotiSharp applies metadata like `Artist` `Title` `Lyrics` `Genres` `Album` `AlbumArt` and more...<br />
Also supports Spotify Url's

Linux users: [README-LINUX](README-LINUX.md)

### Usage

**KEEP THESE KEYS PRIVATE, DO NOT SHARE THEM TO ANYONE**

Create Application on [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) then provide these keys to config.json

        - ClientID
        - Client Secret

Config.json will be generated on first run with empty fields.
```json
{
    "CLIENTID": "",
    "SECRETID": "" 
}
```

FFmpeg is required, but SpotiSharp will download latest binary by itself to the application folder.

SpotiSharp is very easy to use...
```sh
.\SpotiSharp.exe "<Text Search/Spotify URL>"
```
... and thats it. Without any complicated flags, prefixes etc.

SpotiSharp will automatically download all tracks to C:\Users\YOU\MyMusic\SpotiSharp\
