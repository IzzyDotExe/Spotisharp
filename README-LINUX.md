## Music Downloader using Spotify Web API

SpotiSharp applies metadata like `Artist` `Title` `Lyrics` `Genres` `Album` `AlbumArt` and more...<br />
Also supports Spotify Url's

Windows users: [README](README.md)

### Usage

**KEEP THESE KEYS PRIVATE, DO NOT SHARE THEM TO ANYONE**

Create Application on [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) then provide these keys to config.json

        - ClientID
        - Client Secret

Config.json will be generated on first run with empty fields.
```json
{
    "CLIENTID": "",
    "SECRETID": "" 
}
```

FFmpeg is required, but SpotiSharp will download latest binary by itself to the application folder.

**NEVER RUN SPOTISHARP AS ROOT**<br/>
Let's assume you downloaded SpotiSharp and you have terminal opened in SpotiSharp folder.<br/>
Pass this commands to get it working.

```sh
~/Desktop/SpotiSharp$ sudo chmod +x ./SpotiSharp # Gives permission to execute as program.

~/Desktop/SpotiSharp$ ./SpotiSharp "<Text Search / Spotify URL>"
```
... and thats it.

SpotiSharp will automatically download all tracks to <b>/</b>home<b>/</b>Music<b>/</b>SpotiSharp<br/>
SpotiSharp will also scan <b>/</b>home<b>/</b>Music recursively in order to skip already downloaded tracks.
